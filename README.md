# dotfiles  
I guess I should make a dotfiles repo, huh.  
I'm going to throw a bunch of scripts that make it faster to set up a new machine here.  
I'll do my best to keep arcane customizations to a minimum and hopefully other people (especially beginners?) will be able to make use of these scripts.
